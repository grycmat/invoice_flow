# InvoiceFlow MVP Roadmap

## Project Overview

InvoiceFlow is an Angular 20+ invoice management application with a modern glassmorphism design. The current codebase shows a solid foundation with reactive forms, component-based architecture, and professional styling.

## Current State Analysis

### ✅ What's Working

- **Modern Angular 20** with standalone components and signals
- **Reactive Forms** implementation with proper validation
- **Component Architecture** with clear separation of concerns
- **Professional UI** with glassmorphism design system
- **Responsive Design** with mobile-first approach
- **TypeScript** with proper typing and interfaces

### ⚠️ Current Limitations

- **No Data Persistence** - forms don't save data
- **No Backend Integration** - all data is static/mock
- **Missing Core Features** - no invoice generation, PDF export, or client management
- **No State Management** - data flows only through component inputs/outputs
- **Limited Navigation** - only 2 routes (dashboard, create invoice)
- **No Authentication** - hardcoded user data

## Technical Implementation Priorities

### Immediate Actions (This Week)

1. **Set up proper data models** - Create interfaces for all entities
2. **Implement local storage** - Add data persistence layer
3. **Create core services** - InvoiceService, ClientService, CompanyService
4. **Add state management** - Implement simple state management with signals
5. **Complete form validation** - Add comprehensive form validation

### Architecture Improvements

1. **Add proper routing** - Implement all necessary routes
2. **Create shared components** - Reusable UI components
3. **Add error handling** - Global error handling strategy
4. **Implement loading states** - Better UX during data operations
5. **Add data validation** - Server-side validation patterns

## Success Metrics

### MVP Completion Criteria

- [ ] Users can create, edit, and delete invoices
- [ ] Users can manage client information
- [ ] Users can generate PDF invoices
- [ ] Users can view dashboard with real data
- [ ] Application works offline with local storage
- [ ] All forms have proper validation
- [ ] Application is responsive on all devices

### Performance Targets

- [ ] Initial load time < 3 seconds
- [ ] Form interactions < 100ms response time
- [ ] PDF generation < 5 seconds
- [ ] Bundle size < 2MB
- [ ] Lighthouse score > 90

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

- **PDF Generation Complexity** - Start with simple jsPDF implementation
- **Data Migration** - Plan for future backend integration
- **Performance Issues** - Implement lazy loading early
- **Browser Compatibility** - Test on major browsers

### Feature Risks

- **Scope Creep** - Stick to MVP features only
- **User Feedback** - Plan for iterative improvements
- **Data Loss** - Implement robust backup strategies
- **Security** - Plan for future authentication

## Next Steps

1. **Start with Phase 1** - Focus on core invoice management
2. **Set up development environment** - Ensure all tools are ready
3. **Create data models** - Define all interfaces and types
4. **Implement local storage** - Add data persistence
5. **Build invoice CRUD** - Complete basic invoice operations

## Timeline Summary

- **Week 1-2**: Core invoice management
- **Week 3**: Client and company management
- **Week 4**: PDF generation and email
- **Week 5**: Dashboard and analytics
- **Week 6**: Advanced features
- **Week 7**: Polish and optimization

**Total MVP Timeline: 7 weeks**

This roadmap provides a clear path from the current state to a fully functional invoice management application that can compete with existing solutions in the market.
